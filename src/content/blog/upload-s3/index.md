**Upload to s3 bucket**

In order to upload to s3 bucket you just need to follow certain steps:
- Install aws s3 SDK in order generate presigned URL
- Generate the presigned URL using SDK, which consists of command:
  - `put_object` command for upload
  - `get_object` command for accessing the content
- Use the appropriate command and upload or access the content


#### Steps:

1. Generate `access key` and `secret access key` on aws
2. Install the library for your programming language. (I will be using python)
```bash
pip install boto3
```
3. Initialize the S3 SDK for python
```python
import boto3
from botocore.client import Config 
from boto3_type_annotations.s3 import Client

def initialize_s3_client() -> Client:
    s3_client: Client = boto3.client(
        "s3",
        aws_access_key_id=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
        region_name=AWS_REGION,
        # Using v4 for signature
        config=Config(signature_version='s3v4')
    )
    return s3_client
```
4. Generate the presigned URL in order to upload the file
```python
import boto3
from boto3_type_annotations.s3 import Client
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError

def generate_presigned_url_for_upload(
        s3_client: Client,
        bucket_name: str,
        object_name: str,
        expiration: int = 3600,
    ) -> str | None:
        try:
            # Generate a presigned URL for the S3 object to upload file
            response = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
                "put_object",
                Params={
                    "Bucket": bucket_name,
                    "Key": object_name,
                },
                # Expire time of presigned URL in second
                ExpiresIn=expiration,
            )
        except (NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError) as e:
            print("Credentials not available", e)
            return None

        return response
```
5. Generate the presigned URL in order to access the file
```python
import boto3
from boto3_type_annotations.s3 import Client
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError

def get_presigned_url(
    s3_client: Client,
    bucket_name: str,
    object_name: str,
    expiration: int = 3600,
) -> str | None:
    try:
        # Generate a presigned URL for accessing the file from bucket
        response = s3_client.generate_presigned_url(
            "get_object",
            Params={
                "Bucket": bucket_name,
                "Key": object_name,
            },
            # Expire time of presigned URL in second
            ExpiresIn=expiration,
        )
    except (NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError) as e:
        print("Credentials not available", e)
        return None
    return response

```
6. Using the presigned url now you can upload or access the file

**Note:** I have already created a fastapi endpoint to generate presigned url or **You can directly execute the python file**.
I will be using fastapi docs which will fill the value of `bucket_name`, `object_name` and `expiration`

| HTTP Method | Endpoint              |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| GET         | /api/v1/files/presign |
| POST        | /api/v1/files/presign |

- file_name -> bucket_name
- bucket_name -> mukezhz
- expiration -> 3600

### Let's upload the file
![diagram which shows the flow](/assets/aws/s3/architecture-file-upload.png)

- Create a bucket with default configuration
![create-bucket](/assets/aws/s3/create-bucket.png)
**NOTE:** Take great care in which region you have created your bucket

- Generate Presigned URL to upload bruno.png image
![generate-presigned-url-to-upload](/assets/aws/s3/generate-presigned-url-to-upload.png)

- Once presigned URL is obtained use the api client like bruno, postman, insomnia... to upload your file
- Uploading using bruno
![uploading multipart file using bruno](/assets/aws/s3/upload-using-bruno.png)
**NOTE:** HTTP METHOD: **PUT** and **Multipart file** is added (In case of postman **Binary file**)

- Uploading using postman
![uploading binary file in postman](/assets/aws/s3/upload-using-postman.png)

- On Navigating to the s3 bucket. You can see the uploaded file
![see the uploaded file](/assets/aws/s3/mukezhz-bucket.png)

### Let's access the file
- Fill the file_name (ie. object_name) 
![accessing image from presigned url](/assets/aws/s3/generate-presigned-url-to-get.png)

**NOTE:**: object_name should match with file name in s3 bucket in my case `bruno.png`
- Now you can access your file using the generated URL

### What if backend directly upload to s3 bucket?

The client will upload file to backend server and backend server will upload that file by generating presigned URL which we have discussed earlier.

- In this case there is over head upload to backend then again upload to s3 bucket.
- total time taken = uploading from client to backent + uploading from backend to s3
- Instead of uploading twice it is better to generate presigned URL and upload directly from client

#### Consequences of uploading file directly from client

- Once the user get the presigned URL user is able to upload the file unless the URL expires.
- If the bad actor has access to the presigned URL they can pollute the bucket by uploading many files.
- So depending upon situation you need to adjust the expiration time and only allow authorized user to upload the image
