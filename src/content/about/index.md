## Introduction

Hello there! I'm Mukesh Kumar Chaudhary, a software engineer based in Nepal. I enjoy building software that solves real-world problems and helps people. I have a passion for learning new technologies and sharing my knowledge with others. I usually write about software development, productivity, and life. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Hamropatro](https://www.hamropatro.com). I am also a member of [Nepal Open Source Klub](https://www.nosk.org.np/).

## Interest
My interest in software development started back in 2012 when I was in my school. I had a pentium 4 computer of spec: 512MB ram 128GB sata harddisk where I used to play games. I want to become a game developer back then. I was introduced to programming by my brother who was engineering student and he has a laptop. I remember he used to code in black screen back then, now I know it was Turbo C. When I went to 8th grade there used to be computer class where teacher used to teach Q-Basic and HTML and at 10th grade there was something called database. I didn't know what I was doing back then which I found fascinating now.


After completing my secondary school, I went to high school to study computer science. There used to be computer class at 11th grade but not in 12th grade. I was introduced to HTML, CSS, JavaScript. After completing my high school, I went to college to study IT engineering at Nepal College of Information Technology(NCIT). Before joining I researched about mobile game development and I found out that I need to learn java to develop android games. So, before joining college I was learning java on my own by researching on internet. I used to watch youtube videos and read articles on internet but I didn't know what I was doing. I was just copying and pasting the code. I didn't know what I was doing back then. I remember, I always stuck at polymorphism [MANY + FORM]. After several days of trying I got the concept of Object Oriented Programming.

I had a huge expectation from college but it was not what I expected. Since I was learning java on my own, I was ahead of my classmates which helped me learn C easily. I was really disappointed with the college. I used to think once I join the college I will be able to develop game but it didn't happen. I was introduced to open source by NOSK. After joining NOSK I got to know about programming concepts like programming paradigm, open source, linux, helping others, doing projects. Before I used to think programming is just about developing game or software xD, after joining NOSK it changed my perspective. Programming is all about problem solving. So I started learning programming on my own and I have been learning ever since.

## Belief

I don't believe in having skill at a particular language or tool. I believe in learning tools and technique to solve problem. So I learn stuffs depending upon problem. I have worked with following: Java(Micronaut), Golang(gRPC), JavaScript(React, Vue, Svelte), Python(Django, Flask, FastAPI), Docker, Kubernetes, GIT, Linux, Nginx, Ansible, HA Proxy, ElasticSearch ...
